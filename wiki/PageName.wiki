== Use cases A: Sequence creation, editing and annotation ==

=== Use case A11: Vector Sequence creating from (sequence+annotation) ===

It is common that vendor (such as invitrogen) provide sequence in plain text and its annotation in pdf file or other text. User want to build the information into PlasmidRecord and later it is use for visualization or other manupulation.
User get the sequence (usually from the web. eg:  http://www.clontech.com/images/pt/PT3715-SEQ.txt)
User get its additional iniformation (usually from catelog or web. eg: http://www.clontech.com/images/pt/PT3715-5.pdf )
Create new sequence (screenshoot )
Save the file for later use
 

=== Use case A12: Vector sequence creating from NCBI database ===

 Use know vector accession number and want to get into our software
Search in our search dialogbox entering accession number (Eg. NC_000913)
Search result hits are display
User choose the correct one by clicking
The selected GenBank data from NCBI database are downloaded
Display sequence
User may save the file

=== Use case A21: Copying ===

User select a portion of sequence
By mouse drag
By clicking to a annotation
Copy it
User may paste 
Other text receiving application
Creat new PlasmidRecord
Paste to existing PlasmidRecord


=== Use case A31: Sequence annotation ===

This is continuation from Use case A11, however may process from at any time while user designing the plasmid
User get its annotation (usually from catelog or web. eg: http://www.clontech.com/images/pt/PT3715-5.pdf )
Add annotations (screenshoot1, screenshoot2 )
User may save the update


=== Use case A32: Sequence annotation edition ===

User select the annotation
Edit annotation
User may save the update
User may undo the changes
Use case A33: Sequence annotation deletion

User select the annotation
Delete the selected annotation
User may undo delete
 
=== Use case A41: Insert Restriction Sites ===

User select a region
Commend to insert restriction sites (one of the following)
Insert Restriction sites after the selection
Insert Restriction sites before the selection
Insert Restriction site inside the selection
Insert Restriction site outside the selection
