Molecular biology software (MoBio) will be developed as a General purpose software for molecular biologist suitable for visualization of vector sequence, in silico manipulate of plasmids and sequence analysis. MoBio consists of the following 13 packages in four categories. All package are managed .NET assembly. All new package will be written in C# 3.0. Package containing legacy C/C++ files are compiled under CLI manage assembly.

## Utility Packages ##

These packages provide basic utilities functions.
BaseLibrary - Common resource, application and user setting
MathLib - Mathmetical library
Plot - Charting and Plotting (Swordfish.WPF.Charts)

## General Bioinformatic Packages ##

BioCSharp - Basic computational molecular biology
BioCSharp.Algo - Bioinformatics algorithm
BioCSharp.Assembly - Sequence assembly algorithm
BioCSharp.Db - Bioinformatics Database API

## Specific Bioinformatics Packages ##

Muscle - Multiple sequence alignment (C++/CLI)
Primer - Primer design
NcbiWrapper - NCBI C++ toolkit wrapper (C/C++ DLL wrapper)

## User Interface packages ##

MoBio - Main Windows consisting five panels and workspace
MoBio.Contorls - Custom controls for specfic purpose
MoBio.PlasmidCanvas - Plasmid visualization

## System Requirements ##

The first development of the software is target for Microsoft Windows Vista. However it should be usable in Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008. Windows older than XP are not supported.
Hardware requirement

**Dual core CPU**2 GB RAM (minimum), 4 GB recommended
**High speed always on internet access**

Software requirement

**Microsoft SQL Server Express (will be bundled with our software)**Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (will be bundled with our software)

## User Characteristics ##


End-Users of MoBio are expected to be the following
BS, MS or PhD-level biologists located at various research/academic institutions or organizations.
Scientists with several years of research experience in the field of Biology and Bioinformatics

Besides the end users mentioned above, MoBio is also expected to be used by system administrators who will administer update the databases/tools required for effective use of MoBio software.
