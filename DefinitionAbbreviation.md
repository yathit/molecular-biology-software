Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviation


The following are some of the terms used in the document and their definitions

Nucleotide: Represented by each of the characters ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘G’ and ‘C’.

DNA Sequence: A string of nucleotides.

Genome: The entire DNA sequence of an organism.

Protein: A sequence of amino acids, a macromolecule.

Amino acid: Represented by each of the characters, 'F', 'L', 'I', 'M', 'V', 'S', 'P', 'T', 'A', 'Y', 'H', 'Q', 'N', 'K', 'D' 'E', 'C', 'W', 'R', 'G'.

Protein sequence: A string of amino acids.

Peptide sequence: A protein sequence of specified length.

N-mer: A DNA sequence of length 'N'.

Codon: An N-mer of size 3. Each codon represents an amino acid. Different codons can represent the same amino acid. The codons, coding for the start of the coding region are called as start codons, while the codons coding for the termination of the coding region are called as stop codons.

Genetic Code: Table containing the 64 codons, along with the amino acids they code for. The genetic code is specific to an organism.

Genes: Parts of a genome that can be biologically converted to a protein sequence are called genes. Start of a gene can be identified by presence of start codons. End of a gene can be identified by presence of stop codons. In prokaryotes, the entire region between the start codon and the stop codon is converted into a protein sequence. In eukaryotes, some regions between the start codon and stop codon cannot be converted into a protein sequence. Such parts are called introns, while the others are called exons. Genes in eukaryotes will consist of the concatenated exons sequences. Genes are also called coding regions.

Training sets: The set of known genes or protein sequences constitute the training sets to methods, using probability models such as IMMs and Mixed Memory Markov Models. They also constitute the databases used as inputs to BLAST.

GC Content: The percentage of 'G' and 'C' nucleotides in the DNA sequence.

Repeats: DNA or protein sub-sequences which occur with a certain periodicity in input DNA or protein sequences.

E-Value: Expected number of non-homologous sequences with scores greater than or equal to score x, in a database of ‘n’ sequences.
